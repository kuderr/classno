Features:

- save annotations and basic types (dict[str, int] -> dict) ?

More stuff:

- Autovalidating, if needed
- `__setattr__` validation
- Autocasting: strict/lossless or lossy, if needed
- go deep through annotation and validate/cast stuff

Later:

- features on fields
- can set cached properties if immutable ?
